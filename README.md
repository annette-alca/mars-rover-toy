# Welcome to the interactive simulation of a toy robot, the Mars Rover
## This is an exercise in Object-Oriented Programming based on [this test](https://joneaves.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/toy-robot-coding-test/).

This repo has been updated to extend its functionality and log robot controller errors. The original repo had one `Robot class` which was handling several complex behaviours. These have now been split into new classes, more in line with the Single Responsibility Principle of classes. 

## All classes and 4 files are described below. 

1. The <ins>rover.py</ins> code has two parts:
    - A `Robot class` that defines the attributes and behaviours of the toy robot. On initialisation, the `Robot class` relies on other classes in <ins>other_classes.py</ins> to check if initialisation values are valid and if not, raises the `InvalidRobotSpecsError`.
    - A `main` function which is a recursive function enabling interactive control of the robot.

2. <ins>other_classes.py</ins> contains classes and exceptions that <ins>rover.py</ins> rely on:
    - A `Table class` defining the boundaries of the table. The original task involved a 5 x 5 table, this class expands the possibilities. The class can raise an `OutOfBounds` error for any coordinate outside the defined boundaries.
    - A `Facing class` defining the direction of the robot. The original task defined 4 directions (North, East, South, West). Once again, this class expands the possibilities. The class can raise a `DirectionInvalidError` which is useful for typos. 

3. <ins>test_rover_methods.py</ins> has a series of tests for the `Robot class` methods and the `main` function. Test data is also included there. 

4. <ins>test_other_classes.py</ins> contains unit tests for the `Table class` and `Facing class`.


## Instructions:
1. Clone the repo.

2. To start the simulation from the command line, run `python rover.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.

3. To run all the tests, install the pytest library first with `pip install pytest`. Then type `pytest  -v` on the command line.




### Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
