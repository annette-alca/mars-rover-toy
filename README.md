### Welcome to the interactive simulation of a toy robot, the Mars Rover

First, clone the repo.

To start the simulation from the command line, run `python rover.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.

The <ins>rover.py</ins> code has two parts:

- A `Robot class` that defines the attributes and behaviours of the toy robot 
- A `main` function which is a recursive function enabling interactive control of the robot

Both parts are tested in  <ins>test_rover_methods.py</ins>. To run the test, install the pytest module first. Then type `pytest test-rover-methods.py -v` on the command line.

Enjoy ðŸ˜Š

-Annette
