### Welcome to the interactive simulation of a toy robot, the Mars Rover.

To enter the simulation from the command line, run `python rover.py` and follow on-screen instructions.

There are two parts of the <ins>rover.py</ins> code, a `Robot class` that defines the toy robot and 
a `main` function which is a recursive function enabling interactive control of the robot.

Both parts are tested in  <ins>test_rover_methods.py</ins>. To run the tests pytest and type `pytest` on the command line.

Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
