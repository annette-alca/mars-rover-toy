### Welcome to the interactive simulation of a toy robot, the Mars Rover
### This is an exercise in Object-Oriented Programming

This repo has been updated to extend its functionality and log robot controller errors. The original repo had one `Robot class` which was handling complex behaviours (not following SOLID principles). These have now been split into new classes as described below. 

The <ins>rover.py</ins> code has two parts:
- A `Robot class` that defines the attributes and behaviours of the toy robot. It relies on other classes in <ins>other_classes.py</ins> 
- A `main` function which is a recursive function enabling interactive control of the robot.

A second file <ins>other_classes.py</ins> contains classes and exceptions that <ins>rover.py</ins> rely on:
- A `Table class` defining the boundaries of the table. The original task involved a 5 x 5 table, this class expands the possibilities. The class can raise an `OutOfBounds` error for any coordinate outside the defined boundaries.
- A `Facing class` defining the direction of the robot. The original task defined 4 directions (North, East, South, West). Once again, this class expands the possibilities. The class can raise a `DirectionInvalidError` which is useful for typos. 

### Instructions:
First, clone the repo.

To start the simulation from the command line, run `python rover.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.

Some tests are written in  <ins>test_rover_methods.py</ins>. To run the test, install the pytest module first. Then type `pytest test-rover-methods.py -v` on the command line.

Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
